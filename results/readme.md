# Results

This folder contains visualizations of backtesting results:  
- Traditional VaR backtesting results  
- ML Models backtesting results
- Boosting models vs. observed losses
- All ML models vs. observed returns 
- Traditional VaR models vs. observed losses

The figures highlight that boosting-based ML models (especially LightGBM) outperform other approaches in accuracy, coverage, and calibration. These results are consistent with the conclusions presented in the main analysis.
